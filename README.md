The purpose of the application is to list the films or actors by search. On the home page you can find the movies that are playing.
With the selector you can choose if you are going to find a movie or an actor, then write the keywords, and click on the search button.
If a movie was chosen, the query will bring all the possible options that it finds and will list them. If actor was chosen, he will list the possible actors and you can choose one by clicking on his photo; then he will present the different films in which he has worked chronologically.
